  "idea-title": "The idea of KattBNB",
  "idea-p1": "Cancelling a weekend trip because there is no one to look after your cat. Changing your plans because a friend who reluctantly agreed to pet sit bailed the last minute. Dragging your clearly disgruntled cat on a lengthy train ride because that’s the only way to visit your parents for Christmas. If you’re a cat owner, chances are that you’ve been there.",
  "idea-p2": "But what if booking your cat with a trusty petsitter would be as easy as booking yourself in a hotel or Airbnb? What if you wouldn’t have to worry about your furry friends wellbeing while you’re away on holiday?",
  "idea-p3": "We believe if things can be made less difficult, they should. And we believe problems are solved when people come together. That’s why we are building KattBNB - a platform where cat owners can meet cat sitters and booking a boarding for your cat is a breeze. Because hey, it should be.",
