    "header1": "What is KattBNB?",
    "p1": "Our idea of KattBNB is a platform that lets cat sitters offer their services and cat owners book a sitter that is most convenient to them. Think that you could check your cat in with someone you can trust as easy you check yourself in a hotel! That’s what we are building. A full range service that allows you to not only find the right person to look after your cat but also handles the booking, payment, staying in touch and all the other stuff. So you don’t have to worry while you are away.",
    "header2": "When is KattBNB going live?",
