  "description": "War in Ukraine is a humanitarian crisis. Both humans and their pets are suffering immensely. This should not be happening and we do not want to see it happening - yet this is reality. So we want to help. Paws of Piece project is our way how to. </br></br>Below you can find a list of Ukrainian charities - shelters and other animal welfare organisations that are still operational in Ukraine. Some of them are right in the middle in the military conflict yet decided to not evacuate in order to keep caring for animals. They need our help to keep going. And while we can not shelter them from bombs - we can send them funds. </br></br>Before adding them to our list we verify legitimacy of every charity as well as get in touch with them to see which way of donating reaches them the fastest. That way you can know for sure that your donation goes to animals and their humans in need. </br></br>Not everyone can donate, we understand. Here is how you can help out anyway - share the information about this project on your social media:",
